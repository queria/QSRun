Warning:
	This branch is work in progress (porting from ruby to c++).
	
	Everything or nothing can work.

	If you use qsrun from this branch (and this file is still here)
	it is possible that qsrun will have unwanted side effects,
	like erasing your hdd and/or telling your mum that you are drug dealer ;)

	Of course I'm trying to minimise such situations,
	but I don't care if some parts are broken/missing at the moment.

	Queria Sa-Tas
